### Exploratory Data Analysis of Factors Influencing Customer Credibility

Given a dataset spanning April 2005 to September 2005, containing customer information and credit card payment details, the objective is to analyze factors influencing customer credibility. Through variables such as credit limits, repayment statuses, bill amounts, and payment history, this study aims to differentiate between credible and non-credible customers. By exploring demographic attributes like gender, education, marital status, and age, alongside financial behaviors, the goal is to uncover patterns indicative of credit reliability. Insights derived from this analysis can inform financial institutions' risk assessment and decision-making processes when extending credit facilities.
